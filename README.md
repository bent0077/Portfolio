## About the Project (How you created your web portfolio)
For the portfolio,  I used bootstrap for the majority of it because I am not good with CSS. I only used CSS for image hover effects, changing the fonts and anything else I can't use bootstrap. The portfolio follows the 12-point grid system with most of the content arranged in a 2-row column. I tried to use as many images as I can and kept the color scheme simply white and black.

### Challenges Faced 

1. Image hover overlay effects was not working 
2. Navigation links were not working on some pages
3. Couldn't make a drop down link for portfolio 


### Overcoming Challenges

1. Found a code online that worked and changed it to my preference.
2. Added Java script code from bootstrap.
3. Made a separate page with all the portfolio collections with the appropriate links.
